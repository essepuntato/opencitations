This archive contains the dump of the OpenCitations Corpus (OCC, http://opencitations.net) provenance data about provenance agents shared by the whole OCC, created regularly every month.

After unzipping the archive, Disk ARchive (DAR, http://dar.linux.free.fr/, a multi-platform archive tool for managing huge amount of data) is needed for recreating the whole structure. For extracting the DAR archive, please run the command

dar -x [archive-name]

Where "[archive-name"] is the name of the DAR file without final package number and extension. E.g.:

dar -x 2016-09-23-corpus_re
