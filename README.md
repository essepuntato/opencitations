# Open Citations

This is the GitHub repository of the [Open Citations project](http://www.opencitations.net). Its main output is the creation of the *Open Citations Corpus* (*OCC*), i.e., an open repository of scholarly citation data made available under a Creative Commons public domain dedication, which aims to provide accurate citation data in RDF (compliant with the [SPAR Ontologies](http://www.sparontologies.net)) that others may freely build upon, enhance and reuse for any purpose, without restriction under copyright or database law.

This repository contains all the material used to run the corpus and the project website. Please, don't hesitate to [contact us](mailto:contact@opencitations.net) for comments and further questions.
